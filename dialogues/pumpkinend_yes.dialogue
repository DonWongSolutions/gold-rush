Pumpkin King: [speed=1.2] Hmph. Unbelievable. [wait=0.5]

Pumpkin King: I am, regrettably, a man of my words. 75 coins, precisely. [next=auto] You have shown a surprising... resolve. The blight upon this land is lifted.

- Thanks...?
	Pumpkin King: Don't get comfortable. This is but a reprieve! Mark my words, when I return, there will be no deals, no challenges, only destruction!
	
	System: [wait=1] A faint light appears in a nearby drain. Jump into the Pothole to exit the level and escape the Pumpkin King's wrath.
